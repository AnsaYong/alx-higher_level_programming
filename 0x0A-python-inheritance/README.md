This directory contains files generated during the Python - Inheritance lesson of the ALX
software engineering program. A ``tests`` folder containing test files is also included. The

- 0-lookup.py: a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object
- 1-my_list.py: a class MyList that inherits from list
- 2-is_same_class.py: a function that returns ``True`` if the object is exactly an instance of the
  specified class and ``False`` otherwise
- 3-is_kind_of_class.py: a function that checks if an object is an instance of, or if the object is
  an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class
- 4-inherits_from.py: a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that
  inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class; otherwise False
- 5-base_geometry.py: creates an empty class BaseGeometry
- 6-base_geometry.py: creates class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py).
- 7-base_geometry.py: creates class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py).
- 8-rectangle.py: creates a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry.
- 9-rectangle.py: adds more functionality to 8-rectangle.py
- 10-square.py: creates a class Square that inherits from Rectangle
- 11-square.py: creates and instantiates the new class
